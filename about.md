My name is Erik Nilsson. I'm a Husband, Father, and Software Developer.

## Background

I work for Compassion Australia which is a Non-Denominational Child Sponsorship and Advocacy Ministry. I have worked here as a software developer for 10 years, where I focus on the integration of our various systems, and the automation of our business processes. 

Before Compassion, I worked for Forty Two International, a digital marketing company in sydney, on their Email Marketing platform.
